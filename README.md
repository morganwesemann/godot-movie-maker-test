# movie maker test
 Demo project for testing Godot Movie Maker. Loads the default icon and rotates it per the [Creating your first script instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.html) (stopping after the step "turning around") so that I have some rotation that can show in test exports.
